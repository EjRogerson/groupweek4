            <p class="main-text">The fight against poaching has taken a massive toll on certain species' populations such as Elephants, Rhino and Tigers. The syndicates running these operations have invested heavily on state of the art technology, causing the conservationists to look for smarter innovations to tackle the issue. One initiative, based in India, has utilised Artificial Intelligence to conserve their tiger population. Each tiger has a unique stripe pattern. Using camera traps, India has collected a database of each tiger's unique pattern, and thus determine whether the pelt was obtained legally or not.</p>

            <p class="main-text">Another example would be populating the market with synthetic animal goods. Professor Fritz Vollrath from Oxford University who is working with researchers in China to develop synthetic Ivory. Mr. Vollrath says “Ivory is a nice material that people like to handle – but does it have to come from a dead elephant? What if we can create a mixture of collagen and minerals that has the same qualities?” In similar vein, startup Pembient has began replicating rhino horn. When these flood the market, consumers will prefer the cheaper alternative, as well as be unable to identify the difference. The implementation of technology has given us more time to preserve these great beasts.
