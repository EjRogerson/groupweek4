                <p class="main-text">
                      Hydrogen is a high density energy carrier that could potentially be used as a wide-scale alternative to fossil fuels. However, it has so far proven to be too expensive to harvest the large amounts of hydrogen that would be necessary. In a study by a Penn State-led team of researchers supercomputers have been used to find materials that could accelerate hydrogen separation when water is exposed to light. 
                     Sunlight has been used to generate the electricity to separate hydrogen from water but this method has not proven efficient enough to rival traditional fuels. The introduction of a process where sunlight can be used to separate hydrogen, skipping a step, could be the leap needed.

                    The researchers used a computational approach known as high-throughput materials screening to narrow down a list of over 70,000 materials to only 6 promising candidates for the hydrogen separation process. The team developed an algorithm that identified the materials based on their properties that could prove useful. They also chose to focus on oxides because they can be synthesised with standard processes in a reasonable time frame, which would make the production of hydrogen as an alternative to current fuels even more feasible.
                     The research provided by this team shows promising discoveries that could help provide a less damaging fuel for the human race and help to delay the effects of global warming and climate change on the planet.
