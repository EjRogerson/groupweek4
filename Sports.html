                This year’s Olympic Games may be closed to most spectators because of COVID-19, but the eyes of the world are still on the athletes thanks to dozens of cameras recording every leap, dive and flip. Five extra cameras have been added to track and field - the first step in a detailed 3-D tracking system that supplies spectators with near-instantaneous insights into each step of a race or handoff of a baton.
                 The technology on display in Tokyo suggests that the future of elite athletic training lies not merely in gathering data about the human body, but in using that data to create digital replicas of it. These avatars could one day run through hypothetical scenarios to help athletes decide which choices will produce the best outcomes.

                An Intel product called 3DAT, feeds live footage into the cloud. Athletes movements are alayzed and key performance characteristics are identefied using deep learning from an artificial intelligence program.
                The information is shared with the viewers by displaying slow-motion graphic representations of the action, highlighting key moments.
                Jonathan Lee is the director of sports performance technology in the olymipc technology group at Intel gave the following statement; 'It ’s like having your own personal commentator point things out to you in the race'.
