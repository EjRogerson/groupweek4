## Interest of Content (Exemplary)
- Slightly bare index page
- Interesting, well written pages
- Pictures also add interest

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation (Excellent)
- Extremely consistent across content pages on desktop
- Clean presentation
- Easy to read due to margins
- Mobile not as nice
- Menu doesn't work consistently on mobile (Nature page menu button doesn't work)
- Margins inconsistent in mobile
- Image on index page blurred (possibly too large?)

## Quality of written presentation (Exemplary)
- Quality of writing is solid.
- Only one or two grammatical mistakes (eg. Second sentence under image in nature page.)

## Validity of HTML (Excellent)
- All pages missing `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- All pages missing at least one `alt` tag in image elements
- Eco page - Unclosed/stray tags
  - `</container>`
  - `</body>`
  - `</div>`
 - Some inconsistent use of single/double quotes
 - Some lack of quotes inside attributes (eg `class=m-4` instead of `class="m-4"`)
 
 ## Evidence of Collaboration (Very Good)
 - No author information
 - Equal contribution from collaborators (Checked on insights page of github repo)
 - Not completed last minute
